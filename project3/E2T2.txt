Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Config Rule compliance violation: 
- All created S3 buckets: securityhub-s3-bucket-logging-enabled-6984b8b8: Logging isn't enabled for S3 bucket.
- AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    - AttackInstanceSG: securityhub-restricted-ssh-19517ece: Checks whether the incoming SSH traffic for the security groups is accessible. The rule is compliant when the IP addresses of the incoming SSH traffic in the security groups are restricted. This rule applies only to IPv4.
    - WebAppSG: securityhub-restricted-rdp-fe8e6733: Checks whether the incoming RDP traffic is Allowed from 0.0.0.0/0. This rule is compliant when incoming RDP traffic is restricted.
- AWS::EC2::Volume: securityhub-encrypted-volumes-2ddd7654: Checks whether the EBS volumes that are in an attached state are encrypted. If you specify the ID of a KMS key for encryption using the kmsId parameter, the rule checks if the EBS volumes in an attached state are encrypted with that KMS key.
- On Web Application Instance, too many ports are open. 
- Load balancer isn't upgrading the existing HTTP connect to HTTPS (redirection not configured in the HTTP listener).

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- connection should be allowed only on the required ports.
- set up encryption for the S3 buckets.
- set up encryption for the ELB storage.
- Loadbalancer should redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
- Enable logging for the buckets.
- Don't allow ingress from everywhere in security groups. They should be tied to a public IP range (that the developers use) from where the Application can be managed.
